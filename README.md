# Artificial Nose

This repository contains all the instructions, source code, and resources for building your very own DIY artificial nose, powered by TinyML.

## Introduction

Some time back in May 2020, like I'm guessing many other people, I spent quite some time trying to perfect my bread recipe, including trying to determine when my sourdough starter would be in the ideal condition to bake perfect baguettes.

Fast-forward to a few weeks later, I had assembled a full-blown (pun intended!) artificial nose. It can be used for a wide variety of applications, from helping folks suffering from anosmia to spot the smell of burning food or spoiled milk, to monitoring the cleanliness of office buildings, etc.

I am sharing in this repository all the instructions, source code, bill of materials, etc. for you to build and train your very own artificial nose. Enjoy! 👃
